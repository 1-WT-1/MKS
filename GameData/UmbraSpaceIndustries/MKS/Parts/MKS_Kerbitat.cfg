  description = No more being stuffed into a Lander Can for decades at a time!  Our newly improved Kerbitat(tm) habitation module provides everything a Kerbal (and up to two friends) needs to survive in comfort and style.  Includes food preparation facilities, hookups for environmental control, and 30% less explosive decompression than our earlier models.
