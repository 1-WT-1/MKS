description = Originally used as a child's playground set, the Konstruct-O-Matic was later merged with our award winning line of interlocking plastic bricks to create this technological wonder.  Raw resources go in, Large Engineering Geometric Objects come out.  By using lots of these L.E.G.O.s, Kerbals can build a wide variety of structures from the MKS system.  Choking hazard, keep out of reach of small children.  Part of the Modular Kolonization System from Green Mesa Industries.
