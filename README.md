Kerbal Space Program - Modular Kolonization System

Repo for the MKS mod for KSP.  This is a WIP, so at this point I can pretty much guarantee that breaking changes will be introduced in the future.  DO NOT USE THIS ON A SAVE YOU HAVE NOT BACKED UP, and DO NOT USE THIS ON A SAVE YOU DO NOT MIND HAVING TO TRASH LATER.

See the WIKI for documentation, and the KSP Dev Thread to report issues, etc:
